<p>A Church Unlike Others</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">The Church of Diurnus was founded on May 8th, 1997 c.e. The word diurnus (derived from the Latin diurnal) is defined as; recurring daily; going through changes in a day or days.

The Church of Diurnus is not a church the way the common use of the word may suggest. But we are a religious community that provides Self-Schooling for the individual. Working with the idea that each person is a separate component we internalize that each component requires its own special adjustments, maintenance, and care. We are dedicated to the continuum of the individual, to further the Self through conscious effort. We embrace the idea that everything is endogenous.</font>
<center><font size="+2" color="red">
<p>The Narrow Gate</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">Just as churches from all denominational backgrounds require a common participation among their congregation, so does our church. But from that participation the individual is free to seek out his or her own path. Where one might seek the passion of the Evening Star, his brother or sister may seek the light of the Morning Star. Within this process anything that contributes to the growth of the individual is not only encouraged but also demanded. It is a process that can best be described as a pure ongoing creation of the Self---by the Self. With each step that one takes, an inner glow of wonderment, excitement, and intrigue is created; hopefully propelling the individual closer and closer to his or her ego ideal. But this is not to say the path will always be an easy one to travel. There will be hurdles to clear and problems to solve. Some will travel through the mountains as well as valleys. As Herman Hesse wrote in his novel Siddhartha, Everything is necessary&quot;.</font></align=left></td>

<p>The Organic Laboratory</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">In our church there exist no set rules or guidelines to be bothered with---for they are only distractions. Nothing is required except a true willingness to move the Self forward and beyond. Everyone must give and take as much as they can. We must remember that in the course of life we are both student and teacher.

An overall church curriculum is naught. Rather than follow a rigid, dogmatic reading list, we encourage our members to explore experientially ourselves wherever desire might lead. By daily exploration of true desires we gain insight of who we really are underneath our societal roles. As we release the bonds of cultural programming and &quot;normal&quot; behavior, we reclaim the power to choose any manner in which to live our lives. We shed all false notions of self to clearly see life as it is. Our method is the synthesis of ancient and modern thought. The road to freedom is engendered by the realization of the True Will.</font>

<p>A Diurnian Guide to Self - Mutation</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">In order for an individual to advance toward the next step in human evolution a monumental transformation must first occur in the mind. We must look into the mind, at the point of consciousness itself. What is consciousness? It is a state of awareness, which is transmitted within the information-gathering center, whereupon further connections may be developed. These perceptions may be expressed through primitive, atavistic thought-forms. When a symbol is traced to its source it may be used to affect the outside world.

In the beginning true change can only come from an outside source. Its effect must be made at a time when one is open to new imprinting (in moments of intense emotion). Results, which occur from re-imprinting, have proven to create higher order connections and may be used to develop inner-powers and abilities. The aspirant to the <em>inmost light</em> should remember that if this method is done improperly it will create new engrams which, when formed, are difficult to root out and destroy.</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The Process of Elimination-420</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">In order to create one must first destroy. Clearing away and eliminating all debris, which stands in between, what we desire as our chosen objective. Contemplate this alone, entirely free from distractions. Remember to perceive the world <em>As It Is.</em> Look upon yourself from a strictly objective point of view --- some may find this to be a bit unnerving, but persistent analysis proves to be invaluable.

You must erase all preconceived ideas of what you know to be natural and commonplace. Habitual behaviors are to be sacrificed on the proverbial chopping block for they hinder evolution and development on the path. To see things clearly is what we must endeavor --- ample assistance is extended to our brethren. It is the responsibility extended to all <em>seekers of the light</em> by providing any form of sanctuary needed.</font>
<center><font size="+2" color="red">
<p>Possibilities and the Way of Action</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">Only through a rigorous series of self-examination and self-analysis is any of this possible. In most cases outside observation(e.g. - Church Facilitators) is helpful in pointing out possible problems, faults, or oversights. It is the aim of the Church Facilitator to bring members to an accelerated level of awareness and higher-order thinking; to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of one's own life, purpose within the world and influence on others. In the beginning most people are not that quick to admit their wrongs. Furthermore, most individuals are not yet equipped with the kind of inherent clarity needed to see themselves from a distance. But once begun, the spirit of self-awakening and realization, like energy, will tend to generate more itself. New probing into previously unexplored areas will in time produce further probing into other unexplored areas. Given more avenues for one's exploration, man will emerge from himself. Block these avenues, and he will not emerge. Some religious, cultural, and environmental deprogramming may be needed --- but that is solely to the discretion of the individual.</font></td>

<p>Diurnian Architecture and the Inner Environment</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">We must consciously alter the texture of our existence in order to evolve to the next level above human. This process is the elemental force behind all change. One of the main keys is to learn how to integrate one experience to another. We must remember that what goes on outside of our experiences will also translate to what goes on inside of our experiences. The experiences as a whole form the fabric of the <em>Diurnian Process</em>. The whole experience is that which is both within as well as without. If we live directly in this light we become new agents of Mankind. </font>
<center><font size="+2" color="red">
<p>The Human Dimension and God</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">The Church feels that psychology and spirituality may very well be two sides to the same coin. We define God as the essential and divine completeness in man. We feel that modern man is very polluted and that this inner pollution stops him from attaining communion with his <em>Higher-Self</em> or God. It was Plato who said, &quot;Communion with God is the highest state of the human soul.&quot; Man's communion with his God can be brought about through a filtering out process of sorts where unneeded beliefs, habits, traits, compulsions, addictions, etc. are discarded by the individual through learned interdisciplinary action. When communion with one's God is made the individual experiences a state of wholeness or completeness. This new state is almost impossible to describe and is most often only intelligible by sharing the experience. We consider this state of being as the ultimate goal of man. This completeness sustains all that is needed.</font>
<center><font size="+2" color="red">
<p>Building A Better Bridge</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">The Church of Diurnus is Thelemic in nature. We do not mandate any particular rites, rituals, or services for our members to partake in other than those with which they feel comfortable with or embrace as a spiritual necessity. Furthermore, we do not subscribe to any set standards of what Thelemic conduct and beliefs should be other than, though not limited to, the basic tenets stated in Liber LXXVII.<br />

We realize that life is often a series of readjustments and see change as a necessary condition, which may be utilized to bridge the gulf between what is desired and what we actually achieve. The focus must be continuously refined to produce the world, as we <em>will</em> it to be. The possibility of forging this link exists outside the realm of ordinary reality. The gates are barred no longer. The threshold of the <em>Golden Door</em> may be crossed by deliberate intent. Through symbols the mind is able to transcend the boundaries of time.</font>

<p>The Inner Order</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">The Inner Order of Diurnus or IOD consists of twenty-three members and acts as the church synod. Admittance into the Order is by invitation only. Only individuals in good standing and of good report will be considered for admittance into the Order. Admittance is not dependent on age, sex, sexual orientation, race, or ethnic background. The Inner Order reserves the right to modify or update church cannon whenever it may see fit.

We maintain without exception our fundamental rights set fourth in Article One of the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution.</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>In Closing</p></font></center><font size="-1" color="red">Although we do wish to propagate the ideas and understandings of what the Church of Diurnus considers to be the self-evident rights of each mature man and woman, we do not particularly care if the <em>Diurnian Way</em> becomes popularly accepted or not. We believe that popularity almost invariably leads to a deterioration of quality and integrity. The Church of Diurnus focuses on and shall always focus on the overall individual.</font></a>
